# Home-Security-System
This is a cool school project from Programming Principles II, instructions were to create a visual presentation of an object that contains a key pad with JavaFX. My instructor provided the KeyPadPane class, I extended this class to another class to create a Home Security System with buttons, textfields, and selections of panes.

Having Functionality for the project was not required however, I decided to add some functionality the home security system

If you click on 1234 then C, the alarms provides text that states "DISABLED!" if not "Locked". The < buttons clears the textfield
